Now offering the program with an option for you to change the font and background colors as you see fit! Change your colors over and over until you're satisifed, then click on the "Colors Done" button to remove the unsightly buttons.

I have also added a "Reset" button so you don't have to re-launch the program over and over for every new seed.

You're going to be downloading two programs - They are identical but one doesn't have the color options if you prefer not to deal with that.
